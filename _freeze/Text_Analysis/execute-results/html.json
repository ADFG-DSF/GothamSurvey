The staff comments were enlightening but also contained some possibly identifying information. This text analysis of the staff comments represents an effort to share the information contained in the comments broadly while respecting staff privacy.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe DLT was provided with text responses to 9 questions (a total of 836 responses). The complete question, an abbreviation for each question we used in subsequent figures, and the number of responses associated with each question are shown below.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-questions .cell tbl-cap='Gotham Culture survey questions and the number of Division of Sport Fish employee responses.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Full Question                                                                                                                                                                                          |Abreviated Question                    | Number of Responses|\n|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|-------------------:|\n|Q21 How could ADF&G enhance employee safety and wellbeing?                                                                                                                                             |Q21: enhance safety/wellbeing          |                 279|\n|Q31 Aside from monetary compensation, how can ADF&G increase your overall desire to remain with ADF&G?                                                                                                 |Q31: increase retention                |                 152|\n|Q35 We recognize a variety of factors impact your job satisfaction.

We used a technique call [text frequency-inverse document frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) to weight the importance of the words used in each question relative to the use of the same words throughout the entire document. Questions were omitted from @fig-words when there were no highly weighted words. The importance of adequate pay was highlighted by \"monetary\" being the most frequently used word in response to a question that specifically asked employees to exclude monetary considerations from their answer!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Most common words found in Division of Sport Fish employee responses to each survey question.](Text_Analysis_files/figure-html/fig-words-1.png){#fig-words width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA related way to quantify staff comments is to look for the most common bi-grams (2 word sequences) found in the responses to each question. Questions were omitted from @fig-wordpairs when there were no bi-gram repeats.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Most common bi-grams found in Division of Sport Fish employee responses to each survey question.](Text_Analysis_files/figure-html/fig-wordpairs-1.png){#fig-wordpairs width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Text Analysis - Sentiment and Emotion Analysis\n\nSentiment analysis associates words found in the staff responses with databases designed to reflect typical responses to those words. We used two databases. The [AFinn lexicon](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/edoc/imm6006.pdf) associates a numeric sentiment score (-5 to 5) with \\~3,400 words. In this lexicon 5 represent an extremely positive sentiment, 0 is neutral, and -5 is extremely negative sentiment. The [NCR lexicon](http://www.saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm) associates 8 emotions with \\~14,000 words and can associate more than one emotion with the same word. @tbl-lexicon below shows examples from each lexicon based a subset of most common words identified in @fig-words. Note these methods fail to detect sarcasm, misspelling, negation, exc..\n\n\n::: {#tbl-lexicon .cell tbl-cap='AFinn/NCR lexicon examples using words from tf_idf analysis.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Word       | AFinn Lexicon|            NCR Lexicon|\n|:----------|-------------:|----------------------:|\n|safety     |             1|                       |\n|training   |              |                       |\n|enjoy      |             2| trust,joy,anticipation|\n|monetary   |              |           anticipation|\n|disrespect |            -2|                  anger|\n|moral      |              |            trust,anger|\n|bias       |            -1|                  anger|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe AFinn sentiment analysis was run on each response separately and provides a sense of the sentiment associated with each response and of the distribution of sentiments across responses within each question. Based on the AFinn lexicon words used in responses to questions involving enhanced safety, increased retention, and workload had generally positive sentiment while words used in responses to questions involving bias, reporting and disrespect had generally negative sentiment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![AFinn lexicon results for each Division of Sport Fish employee response.](Text_Analysis_files/figure-html/fig-afinn-1.png){#fig-afinn width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe NCR emotion analysis was run on all responses for each question and gives a general idea of the emotional content in the responses to each question. Based on the NCR lexicon words used in responses to questions involving enhanced safety, increased retention, and workload were more often associated with emotions of trust and anticipation while words used in responses to questions involving bias, reporting and disrespect were more often associated with emotion of anger.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in inner_join(., get_sentiments(\"nrc\"), by = \"word\", multiple = \"all\"): Detected an unexpected many-to-many relationship between `x` and `y`.\nℹ Row 28 of `x` matches multiple rows in `y`.\nℹ Row 7510 of `y` matches multiple rows in `x`.\nℹ If a many-to-many relationship is expected, set `relationship =\n  \"many-to-many\"` to silence this warning.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![NCR lexicon results for the set of all Division of Sport Fish employee responses to each question.](Text_Analysis_files/figure-html/fig-wordspairs-1.png){#fig-wordspairs width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
