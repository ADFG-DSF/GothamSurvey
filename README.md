# GothamSurvey

This repository stores files used to summarize the gothamCulture Division of Sport Fisheries survey report and the written answers Division of Sport Fisheries employees provided to to open-ended questions within the same survey.

The network location for this repository is S:\\RTS\\Reimer\\GothamSurvey although the input files (Copy of Sport Fish survey comments_sg.xlsx and SPF Report 31 Mar 2023.pdf) are stored on Adam Reimer's H drive at H:\\My Documents\\DLT\\GothamSurvey. The input data contained potentially identifying information which caused the DLT to decide they should not be released in their entirety. The input files are also stored on the DLT private file repository on SharePoint.
